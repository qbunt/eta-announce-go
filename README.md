## eta-announce-go
A rebuild of [my earlier attempt](https://github.com/qbunt/eta-announce) to build a small service to notify family members of ETA on the daily commute. Currently, this is manually triggered via Alfred, but the original plan to trigger based on geolocation.

There are multiple issues with this, and really it's not hard to ping a URL manually.
